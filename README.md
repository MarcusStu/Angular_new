# A C# MVC Project with AngularJS, AJAX, Json & some bootstrap.

Assignment Description:
My assignment was to build a Single Page Application (SPA) that serves as a CMS for a database 
(a web-based interface for interacting with data inside a database).	

The page has a list of people, which when clicked on will show detailed information about that person 
(their full name, email, adress, city and country). 

This data is possible to change, and doing so updates the database backing the page.
